# No O1 manual

This is a pdf copy of the web page found at
[monopole.cc](https://monopole.cc/en/product/manual).

I made the copy because I was a bit exasperated continually clicking
reveals on the web page to see the text.  It's mostly legal stuff and
not very interesting, to be honest, although there are a few useful
pointers that might come up maintaining the bike over the long term.

Legal notes:
* This is considered a fair use copy, as it's made purely to facilitate reading the material as well as reading it offline.  The material here is Copyright by Monopole, as far as I can tell, and is in plain public view on their [website](https://monopole.cc/en/product/manual).
* If you're Monopole and you'd like me to transfer this repository to you, just send me a mail (you have my info, I'm a customer) with your git id so I can transfer it.  I'll fork it back here to preserve the URL and provide an onward pointer.
